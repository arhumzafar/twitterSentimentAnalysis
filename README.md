# twitterSentimentAnalysis

#### Arhum Zafar - November 2020

By looking at the sentiment of posts on the internet, whether they are positive, negative, or neutral -- we can understand how people feel about certain topics. 
Furthermore, understanding the sentiment of the tweets can be vital for different purposes such as: information gathering, politics, marketing & advertising, behavior analysis, and more. 
<br>
<br>
In this project, we'll be analyzing the sentiment of tweets; however analysis on Twitter is not a trivial task. According to 
[Brandwatch](https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/twitter-stats-and-statistics/#:~:text=Twitter%20usage%20statistics,That's%206%2C000%20tweets%20every%20second.),
roughly 6,000 tweets are posted each second. This obivously yields an influx of data to process which poses a problem since human sentiment analysis is not easily scalable.
<br>
<br>
In this notebook, I'll try to look at the foundation of a sentiment analysis model that could be built to scalae which also takes in part of the text-cleaning process.

thanks.
